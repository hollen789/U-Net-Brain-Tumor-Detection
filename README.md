A 2D U-Net-based model to segment brain tumors from a multi-modal MRI, focusing on two
key MRI modalities by leveraging U-Net’s encoder-decoder structure, the aim is to accurately
identify the presence and boundaries of different tumor subregions, thus providing a model
that can assist in clinical decision-making.

Worked with an online Dataset(BraTS2020 dataset) and altered its contents to better
display the trained model’s ability to detect tumors in random patient samples
